## 1 Exercises

### 1.1

1.1 Rotation (10 Points)
Figure. 1(b) was generated by:

1. Multiplying Fig. 1(a) by $(-1)^{x+y}$ ;
2. Computing the discrete Fourier transform;
3. Taking the complex conjugate of the transform;
4. Computing the inverse discrete Fourier transform;
5. Multiplying the real part of the result by $(-1)^{x+y}$.

Explain (mathematically) why Fig. 1(b) appears as it does.

Proof:

Computing the discrete Fourier transform
$$
f(x,y)(-1)^{x+y}\Leftrightarrow F(u-M/2,v-N/2)
$$
taking the complex conjugate of the transform, applying the conjugate symmetry
$$
F^*(u-M/2,v-N/2)=F(-u+M/2,-v+N/2)
$$
computing the IDFT 
$$
\begin{aligned}
&F(-u+M/2,-v+N/2)\\
=&F((-u+M)-M/2,(-v+N)-N/2)\\
\Leftrightarrow&f(-x+M,-y+N)(-1)^{x+y}
\end{aligned}
$$
multiplying the real part of the result by $(-1)^{x+y}$, then we get the reconstructed image $\hat{f}$
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\hat{f}(x,y)\\
=&f(-x+M,-y+N)(-1)^{x+y}(-1)^{x+y}\\
=&f(-x+M,-y+N)
\end{aligned}
$$
so, the reconstructed image is center-symmetric about(M/2,N/2)

### 1.2

For being padded with zeros, the original image add a black edging, which is different from the original white edging. Thus the image change more intensively and brings the significant increase in signal strength along the vertical and horizontal axes of image.

### 1.3

(1)
$$
g(x,y)=f(x,y-1)+f(x-1,y)-4f(x,y)+f(x+1,y)+f(x,y+1)
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
G(u,v)=&F(u,v)(e^{-j2\pi v/N}+e^{-j2\pi u/M}+e^{j2\pi u/M}+e^{j2\pi v/N}-4)\\
=&F(u,v)(cos(2\pi v/N)-jsin(2\pi v/N)+cos(2\pi u/M)-jsin(2\pi u/M)\\
&+cos(2\pi u/M)+jsin(2\pi u/M)+cos(2\pi v/N)+jsin(2\pi v/N)-4)\\
=&2F(u,v)(cos(2\pi v/N)+cos(2\pi u/M)-2)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\therefore H(u,v)=2(cos(2\pi v/N)+cos(2\pi u/M)-2)
$$

(2)

when (u,v)->(0,0), H(u,v)->0; when (u,v) is far from (0,0), |H(u,v)| gets greater.

So H(u,v) is a high-pass filter.

## 2 Programming Tasks

My student ID is 16327109, so I choose "09.png" as my input.

### 2.1

1. Perform DFT and manually paste the (centered) Fourier spectrum on your report. (10
   Points)

   

2. Perform IDFT on the result of the last question, and paste the real part on your report.
    Note: the real part should be very similar to your input image. (Why? Think about it.) (10
    Points)

  

3. Detailed discuss how you implement DFT / IDFT in less than 2 pages. Please focus on
    the algorithm part. Don’t widely copy/paste your codes in the report, since your codes
    are also submitted. 

To reduce time complexity of DFT/IDFT, we have to separate the 2-D DFT into 1-D transforms. We can write as
$$
F(u,v)=\sum_{x=0}^{M-1}e^{-j2\pi ux/M}\sum_{y=0}^{N-1}f(x,y)e^{-j2\pi vy/N}=\sum_{x=0}^{M-1}F(x,v)e^{-j2\pi ux/M}
$$
By doing this, we reduce the time complexity of $O(M^2N^2)$ to $O(MN(M+N))$.

We first apply 1-D DFT/IDFT of a row of f(x,y). By varying x from 0 to M-1, we compute a set of 1-D DFTs for all rows of f(x,y). Then we apply 1-D transforms of the columns of F(x,v).

DFT and IDFT are only different on the sign of $e^{j2\pi x/M}$, so we can only change the sign of exponent to do DFT or IDFT.

```
python dtf.py 0

0 for DFT, 1 for IDFT
